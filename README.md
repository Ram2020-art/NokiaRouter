# Nokia Router Search and Replace

This project is a simple web application that allows users to type text into an input field, search for occurrences of "ALCL", replace them with "414C434C", and copy the modified text to the clipboard. If "ALCL" is not present in the input, the application will prepend "(414C434C)" to the input text.

## Features

- Replace all instances of "ALCL" with "414C434C" in the input text.
- If "ALCL" is not present, prepend "(414C434C)" to the input text.
- Copy the modified result to the clipboard with a single button click.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Type your text into the input field.
3. Click the "Search" button to process the text.
4. The modified result will be displayed below the input field.
5. Click the "Copy Result" button to copy the modified text to the clipboard.
